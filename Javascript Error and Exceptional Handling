## Javascript Error and Exceptional Handling

** What is JavaScript Error?
In JavaScript, an error is a problem that prevents the code from running as expected.
Errors can occur during development or while the application is running, causing the program to stop executing properly. 
There are different types of errors in JavaScript.

** Types of Errors in JavaScript
1) Syntax Errors: 
This happens when the code doesn't follow the correct syntax 
(e.g., missing parentheses, brackets, or commas).

e.g
console.log("Hello World" 
output:-
Missing closing parenthesis

2) Reference Errors: 
Occurs when we try to access a variable that hasn’t been declared.

e.g.
console.log(x); 
output:-
// ReferenceError: x is not defined
