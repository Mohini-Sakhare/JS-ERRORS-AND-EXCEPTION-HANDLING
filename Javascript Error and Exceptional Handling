## Javascript Error and Exceptional Handling

** What is JavaScript Error?
In JavaScript, an error is a problem that prevents the code from running as expected.
Errors can occur during development or while the application is running, causing the program to stop executing properly. 
There are different types of errors in JavaScript.

** Types of Errors in JavaScript
1) Syntax Errors: 
This happens when the code doesn't follow the correct syntax 
(e.g., missing parentheses, brackets, or commas).

e.g
console.log("Hello World" 
output:-
Missing closing parenthesis

2) Reference Errors: 
Occurs when we try to access a variable that hasn’t been declared.

e.g.
console.log(x); 
output:-
// ReferenceError: x is not defined

3) Type Errors: 
This happens when a value is not of the expected type 
(e.g., trying to call a method on undefined).

e.g.
let num = 5;
num.toUpperCase(); 

output:-
// TypeError: num.toUpperCase is not a function

4) Range Errors: 
Occurs when a value is out of range, like passing an invalid number to a function.

e.g.
let arr = Array(-1); 
output:
// RangeError: Invalid array length

5) Custom Errors: 
A custom error is an error that you create yourself to give more specific messages that make sense for your app. 
It helps you explain exactly what went wrong in a way that's easy to understand and fix.

throw new Error("Custom error occurred");

output:
Error: Custom error occurred

## Exception Handling in JavaScript
Exception handling in JavaScript refers to the process of dealing with errors (exceptions) that occur during the execution of a program. 
JavaScript provides some mechanisms to catch, handle, and recover from error instead of letting the error stop the program. The most common approach is using try...catch blocks

## Handling Errors Using try...catch
The try...catch statement

Try Block: You place code that may potentially throw an error here.
Catch Block: This block executes if an error occurs in the try block.
finally Block: The Code inside this block will always run, whether an error occurred or not.

Syntax

try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
} finally {
  // Optional: Code that runs regardless of success or error
}

e.g.
try {
    let res = 10 / 0;
    if (!isFinite(res)) {
        throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero");
    }
    console.log(res);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error occurred:", error.message);
} finally {
    console.log("Execution completed");
}

output:-
Error occurred: Cannot divide by zero
Execution completed

## Throwing Custom Errors
Sometimes, the standard JavaScript errors are not sufficient for our application needs. 
In such cases, you can throw custom errors using the throw statement.

e.g.
function check(age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new Error("Age must be 18 or above");
    }
    console.log("Access granted");
}
try {
    check(16);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
    // Age must be 18 or above
}

output:-
Age must be 18 or above

In this example

The check() function checks if the age is less than 18. If it is, it throws an error with the message "Age must be 18 or above."
The try block calls the check() function with 16 as the argument. 
Since 16 is less than 18, an error is thrown.
The catch block catches the error and displays the error message "Age must be 18 or above" using console.error().

## Using Finally for Cleanup
The final block is executed regardless of whether an error occurred or not.
